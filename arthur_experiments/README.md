Arthur's experiments: Transformer Variational Autoencoder
========

This repository gathers the experiments conducted by Arthur Vive around the theme of spatially equivariant variational autoencoders.
* In model zoo, you will find different architectures of autoencoders in lasagne
* In experiment_set, you will find the code which produces output for the comparison of the different models.
